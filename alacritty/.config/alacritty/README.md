# Alacritty

To configure [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) I've followed mainly the [ArchLinux wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Alacritty).

The main topics and configurations are the font to use and the color scheme. For managing themes without needing to write all the configuration
there are several packages, the easiest ones for me are [pycritty](https://github.com/antoniosarosi/pycritty) and [alacritty-theme](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme)
